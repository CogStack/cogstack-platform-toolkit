# Cogstack Observability

This project provides observability of a cogstack deployment.

It provides the following features:
- Dashboards for availability
- Telemetry of infrastructure such as host memory usage, and elasticsearch index size
- Alerting based on a defined Service Level Objective (SLO) and burn rates
- Blackbox Probing of services to find service level indicators of uptime and latency
- A working inventory of what is running where


See the [Quickstart](./get-started/quickstart.md) to see how to easily run this stack.
