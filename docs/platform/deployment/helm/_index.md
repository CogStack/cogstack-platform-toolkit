# Helm


Helm is our recommended way to deploy CogStack. It simplifies installing, upgrading, and managing all the components through easy-to-use charts.

For a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough on deploying CogStack with Helm, please see the [Tutorial](./tutorial.md).

To understand how the Helm charts are structured and how they work under the hood, check out the [architecture](./architecture) section.
