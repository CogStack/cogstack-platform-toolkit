These examples demonstrate how to deploy CogStack infrastructure quickly using Terraform. Each example typically requires just one or two `terraform apply` commands to create all the required infrastructure and run CogStack.

Use them as a starting point or reference for your own deployments.

Please note these examples are for demonstration and testing only. We do not advise using these with any real production data without review. Cloud infrastructure can be complex, and your IT department likely has guidelines or governance rules you’ll need to follow when moving beyond these basic setups.
