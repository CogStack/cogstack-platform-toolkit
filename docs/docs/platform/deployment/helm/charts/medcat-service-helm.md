# MedCAT Service Helm Chart

This Helm chart deploys the MedCAT service to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Installation

```sh
helm install medcat-service-helm oci://registry-1.docker.io/cogstacksystems/medcat-service-helm
```

## Usage

For local testing, by default you can port forward the service using this command:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/medcat-service-helm 5000:5000
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:5000 to try the service. You can also use http://localhost:5000/docs to view the REST APIs

## Configuration

To configure medcat service, create a values.yaml file and install with helm.

### Model Pack

You should specify a model pack to be used by the service. By default it will use a small bundled model, which can be used for testing

---

#### Default: Use the demo model pack

There is a model pack already bundled into medcat service, and is the default in this chart.

This pack is only really used for testing, and has just a few concepts built in.

#### Recommended: Download Model on Startup

Enable MedCAT to download the model from a remote URL on container startup.

Create a values file like `values-model-download.yaml` and set these values:

```yaml
model:
  downloadUrl: "http://localhost:9000/models/my-model.zip"
  name: my-model.zip
```

Use this if you prefer dynamic loading of models at runtime.

#### Advanced: Create a custom volume and load a model into it

The service can use a model pack if you want to setup your own download flow. For example, setup an initContainer pattern that downloads to a volume, then mount the volume yourself.

1. Create a persistent volume and PVC in kubernetes following the official documentation. Alternatively specifiy it in `values.extraManifests` and it will be created.

2. Create a values file like the following, which mounts the volume, and defines a custom init container.

```yaml
env:
  APP_MEDCAT_MODEL_PACK: "/my/models/custom-model.zip"
volumeMounts:
  name: model-volume
  mountPath: /my/models

volumes:
  - name: model-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: my-custom-pvc
extraInitContainers:
  - name: model-downloader
    image: busybox:1.28
    # In this command, you can write custom code required to download a file. For example you could configure authentication.
    command:
      ["sh", "-c", "wget -O /my/models/custom-model.zip http://example.com"]
    volumeMounts:
      - name: model-volume
        mountPath: /my/models
```

### DeID Mode

The service can perform DeID of EHRs by swithcing to the following values

```
env:
  APP_MEDCAT_MODEL_PACK: "/cat/models/examples/example-deid-model-pack.zip"
  DEID_MODE: "true"
  DEID_REDACT: "true"
```

### GPU Support

To run MedCAT Service with GPU acceleration, use the GPU-enabled image and set the pod runtime class accordingly.

Note GPU support is only used for deidentification

Create a values file like `values-gpu.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
image:
  repository: ghcr.io/cogstack/medcat-service-gpu

runtimeClassName: nvidia

resources:
  limits:
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1
env:
  APP_CUDA_DEVICE_COUNT: 1
  APP_TORCH_THREADS: -1
  DEID_MODE: true
```

> To use GPU acceleration, your Kubernetes cluster should be configured with the NVIDIA GPU Operator or the following components:
>
> - [NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin)
> - [NVIDIA GPU Feature Discovery](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-feature-discovery)
> - The [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/)

#### Test GPU support

You can verify that the MedCAT Service pod has access to the GPU by executing `nvidia-smi` inside the pod.

```sh
kubectl exec -it <POD_NAME> -- nvidia-smi
```

You should see the NVIDIA GPU device listing if the GPU is properly accessible.
